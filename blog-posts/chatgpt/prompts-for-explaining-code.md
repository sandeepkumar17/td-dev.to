## Coding Best Practices or Principles Explained:

Code can often be complex and difficult to decipher, especially for developers who are new to a project or for team members who are collaborating on the same codebase.

By explaining the code, developers can bridge the gap between the code itself and the understanding of its purpose, functionality, and logic. This helps in troubleshooting, debugging, and maintaining the codebase effectively. It also promotes knowledge sharing, collaboration, and documentation, ensuring that the code is comprehensible and accessible to all stakeholders involved.
