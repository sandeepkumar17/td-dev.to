## Regular Expression and its usage:
A regular expression, often referred to as regex or regexp, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is a powerful tool used for pattern matching and manipulating text data. Regular expressions are widely used in various programming languages, text editors, and command-line tools.

Regular expressions consist of a combination of literal characters and special characters called metacharacters. Metacharacters have special meanings and allow you to define patterns using features like repetition, alternation, grouping, and more.

The usage of regular expressions can vary depending on the context, but here are some common scenarios:
* **Pattern Matching:** Regular expressions are primarily used for pattern matching in strings. They allow you to search for specific patterns or sequences of characters within a larger text. For example, you can use a regular expression to find all phone numbers in a document or to extract email addresses from a string.
* **Validation:** Regular expressions are often employed for data validation. They can help ensure that user input follows a specific format or pattern. For instance, you can use a regular expression to validate whether a given string is a valid credit card number, date, or URL.
* **Text Manipulation:** Regular expressions can be used to manipulate text by performing search and replace operations. You can search for a specific pattern and replace it with another string or modify its format.
* **Parsing and Extracting Data:** Regular expressions are handy for parsing and extracting data from structured text. For example, you can use regular expressions to extract information from log files, scrape data from web pages, or parse HTML or XML documents.
* **Lexical Analysis:** Regular expressions play a crucial role in lexical analysis, which is the process of tokenizing and analyzing the structure of a programming language. They are used to define the syntax rules for identifying keywords, operators, and other language constructs.

> While regular expressions are a powerful tool, they can also be complex and require careful crafting to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, different programming languages may have slight variations in their regular expression syntax.
