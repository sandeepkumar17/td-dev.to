## ChatGPT Prompts for Writing and Generating Codes:

Sharing a list of the prompts that can help you to use ChatGPT more efficiently.

Replace the words in [] to get the desired result. You can replace the given language with a choice of your language, i.e., C#, JavaScript, Python, NodeJS, etc.

### Create Prompts
```

Create a code snippet for Checking for substrings in C#

Create a function that merges two lists into a dictionary in JavaScript.

Create a C# function to swap two numbers.

Create a Python script to sort an array of strings.

Create a Java function that converts integer array into string array.

Create a JavaScript function to return the sum of the given array with the following inputs: [17, 18, 15, 19, 14].

Create a C# program that reads a string array, performs sorting, and then writes the results to a CSV file.

Create a Python script to parse the CSV file, extract the first column, and store the data in a string array with the following requirements: skip the header row.
