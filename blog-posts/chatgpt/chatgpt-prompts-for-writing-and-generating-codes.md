## ChatGPT Prompts for Writing and Generating Codes:

Sharing a list of the prompts that can help you to use ChatGPT more efficiently.

Replace the words in `block` to get the desired result, for example, replace the `language` with a choice of your language, i.e., C#, JavaScript, Python, NodeJS, etc.
