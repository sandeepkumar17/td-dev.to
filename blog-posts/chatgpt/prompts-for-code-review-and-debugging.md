## Why Code Review and Debugging is important:

Code review and Debugging are crucial in software development. They help identify and fix bugs, improve code quality, enhance software reliability, optimize performance, promote knowledge sharing, ensure adherence to coding standards, and mitigate risks and vulnerabilities.

## ChatGPT Prompts for Code Review and Debugging:

Sharing a list of the prompts that can help you to use ChatGPT to review the code and debugging.

Replace the words in `block` to get the desired result, for example, use your choice of language, i.e., `C#`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, `NodeJS`, etc.
